# 001. Simple Solidity Contract

I am taking notes on my web3 practices, in 100-day-code style. 
This is about local ETH smart contract development setup. The topic of 
the contract is arithmetic operations.

## Environment Setup

Install web3.js and hardhat for local development:

```sh
npm init
npm i web3 
npm i --save-dev hardhat
```

Init hardhat: `npx hardhat`. It is possible to select Typescript as PL.

npm install --save-dev chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle

Add `require` statement to the top of hardhat.config.js:
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

## Coding

Two notable files for the sake of this practice are "contracts/Alu.sol" and "scripts/interact_alu.js". The smart contract keeps a variable and methods to update it with addition and multiplication opearations. Interaction script uses addition and displays the capsulated resulting value.

The deployment is done with "scripts/local.js".

## Reference

As a further reference you can see [Hardhat Quick Start page](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start).
