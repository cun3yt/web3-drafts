# 004. ERC20 Implementation

For this one, we will try Hardhat with Typescript setup based on [this tutorial](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/typescript):

```bash
npm i --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

```

Interface Functions:

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256);
function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public view returns (uint);
function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public view returns (uint);
function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool);
function approve(address spender, uint tokens)  public returns (bool);
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool);
```

Interface Events:

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
```

Additional Fields Turned to Be Common:

```solidity
string public constant name;
string public constant symbol;
uint8 public constant decimals;
```

It is common to keep two mapping objects:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) balances;
mapping(address => mapping (address => uint256)) allowed;
```

## Supply Mechanism

There is a discussion of different methods in [this article](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226): 

1. Fixed Supply
1. Rewarding Miners
1. Modularizing the Mechanism
1. Automating the Reward

## Logging with Hardhat

```
import "hardhat/console.sol";

console.log(
    "Giving allowance from %s to %s for %s tokens",
    msg.sender,
    spender,
    amount
);
```

## Deploying Contract

`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts  --network sepolia`

## Contract Address

Deployed to Sepolia via Infura. Address:  [0x6C40948215Cf406AABBD0285EAF8a7a1246879D1](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6c40948215cf406aabbd0285eaf8a7a1246879d1).

## Q & A

1. **Question:** From [this article](https://www.toptal.com/ethereum/create-erc20-token-tutorial), "An event is Solidityâ€™s way of allowing clients e.g. your application frontend to be notified on specific occurrences within the contract". How to get subscribed to Solidity events to update frontend application?
